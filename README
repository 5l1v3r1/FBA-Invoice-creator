This is a very simple version of the Ruby utility I wrote to generate invoices from FBA (Fulfilled by Amazon)

I usually export the full orders csv file and delete the first line of headers.

I then generate one invoice per order, including several items, shipping and VAT

You're welcome to modify this script to make it more modular and send a pull request if you see fit.

I have included a bogus amazon.csv file

INSTALL
=========

You need:

* Ruby (I have 1.8.7)
* prawn gem (sudo gem install prawn)

You may need lmatest gem (>1.3.6), in which case a sudo gem update --system should help you
