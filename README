This is a very simple version of the Ruby utility I wrote to generate invoices from FBA (Fulfilled by Amazon)

I usually export the full orders csv file and delete the first line of headers.

I then generate one invoice per order, including several items, shipping and VAT

You're welcome to modify this script to make it more modular and send a pull request if you see fit.

I have included a bogus amazon.csv file
